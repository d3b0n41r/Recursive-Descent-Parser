# Recursive-Descent-Parser
RDP for boolean expressions with a tree view in Console mode

expressions must be in format ((a.b).a) or (a.b) or ((a.b)+(a.b)) e.g encased in brackets

tree can be depth first traversed to create logic circuit
each node in the tree either stores the type of operator / logic gates (e.g AND = '.', OR = '+') or the input e.g ('a', 'B')
